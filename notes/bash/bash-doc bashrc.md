# ~/.bashrc

There is a special bash script called `~/.bashrc` that runs whenever you start bash. You can edit this file to set up aliases, environment variables, and run commands when you start a new terminal session.

---

At the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` file, try adding a command:

```bash
echo Greetings $USER. Nice to see you again.
```

Now open a new terminal and you should see a friendly new message!

#unix #bash
