# cgroups
> Google saw this same problem when building their own infrastructure and wanted to protect runaway processes from taking down entire servers and made this idea of cgroups so you can say "this isolated environment only gets so much CPU, so much memory, etc. and once it's out of those it's out-of-luck, it won't get any more."

Outside of unshare'd environment get the tools we'll need here. **RUN:**
```bash
apt-get install -y cgroup-tools htop

# create new cgroups
cgcreate -g cpu,memory,blkio,devices,freezer:/sandbox

# add our unshare'd env to our cgroup
ps aux # grab the bash PID that's right after the unshare one
cgclassify -g cpu,memory,blkio,devices,freezer:sandbox <PID>

# list tasks associated to the sandbox cpu group, we should see the above PID
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/sandbox/tasks

# show the cpu share of the sandbox cpu group, this is the number that determines priority between competing resources, higher is is higher priority
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/sandbox/cpu.shares

# kill all of sandbox's processes if you need it
# kill -9 $(cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/sandbox/tasks)

# Limit usage at 5% for a multi core system
cgset -r cpu.cfs_period_us=100000 -r cpu.cfs_quota_us=$[ 5000 * $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) ] sandbox

# Set a limit of 80M
cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=80M sandbox
# Get memory stats used by the cgroup
cgget -r memory.stat sandbox

# in terminal session #2, outside of the unshare'd env
htop # will allow us to see resources being used with a nice visualizer

# in terminal session #1, inside unshared'd env
yes > /dev/null # this will instantly consume one core's worth of CPU power
# notice it's only taking 5% of the CPU, like we set
# if you want, run the docker exec from above to get a third session to see the above command take 100% of the available resources
# CTRL+C stops the above any time

# in terminal session #1, inside unshare'd env
yes | tr \\n x | head -c 1048576000 | grep n # this will ramp up to consume ~1GB of RAM
# notice in htop it'll keep the memory closer to 80MB due to our cgroup
# as above, connect with a third terminal to see it work outside of a cgroup
```
