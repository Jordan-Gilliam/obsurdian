# Tuples
> A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed using parentheses `()`, and each tuple itself is a value with type signature `(T1, T2, ...)`, where `T1`, `T2` are the types of its members. Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.
