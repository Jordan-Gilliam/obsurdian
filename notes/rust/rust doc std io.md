> By default, Rust brings only a few types into the scope of every program in [the _prelude_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html). If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a `use` statement. Using the `std::io` library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept user input.
